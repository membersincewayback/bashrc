# bashrc
My Bash/Vim profile. I make no guarantee this will work for you.

I am currently using this on:
- Debian 12
- OpenBSD 7.3
- Ubuntu 23.04 Desktop
- Ubuntu 22.04 Server
- Raspberry Pi OS Lite (bullseye)

I recently completed a migration of my homelab away from RHEL products.
My Github reflects my hobby, and that hobby is FOSS.
